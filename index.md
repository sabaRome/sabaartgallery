                <h3>Opening Words:</h3>

                <p class="text-lg">My works are abstract paintings that manifest through the form of Siyah-Mashq in Persian Nasta平l朝q script.</p>
                <p class="text-lg">Not writings meant to be read by Persian speakers, but compositions intended to evoke reflection.</p>
                <p class="text-lg">They are forms to be seen, not texts to be read, though they are made of Persian letters and words.</p>
            </div>

        

        <div>
            <h3>Following Words:</h3>

            <p class="text-lg">In these works, the letters and words are not chosen randomly or arbitrarily.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">They are selected verses from the poetic world of unparalleled Persian poets, each carrying a message that is linguistic, profound, and unique. </p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-lg">A paradox? Perhaps.</p>

        <div class="">
            <p class="text-lg">But like a choreographer who creates rhythm and harmony through the arrangement of movements, or like an abstract painter who expresses their thought through geometric forms, regular or irregular, I create harmony, order, and motion using the letters and words of Nasta平l朝q.</p>
            <p class="text-lg">Therefore, my audience spans a broad spectrum, from those who know only the Persian language to those who do not, but who understand the language of visual form.</p>

    <div class="space-y-2 md:col-span-4">
        <p>An immersive and meditative workshop inviting participants to explore the poetic and visual language of Persian calligraphy. Through guided exercises, live demonstrations, and hands-on practice, participants will experience the timeless beauty of Persian poetry, the mathematical elegance of the Nastaliq script, and the harmony of form, rhythm, and presence that calligraphy uniquely offers.</p>
        <p>The name “Presence in the Moment” is rooted in the precise mathematical rules and geometric laws that form the foundation of Persian calligraphy. Especially in the Nastaliq style, each letter and curve is governed by proportion, symmetry, and carefully measured rhythm. This structural discipline demands more than artistic flair, it calls for complete attention and deep presence. To create such harmony and elegance, one must be fully engaged in each stroke. That is why Nastaliq carries both solid structure and graceful fluidity: it lives entirely in the present. Every stroke becomes a quiet act of focus, and every composition a meditative return to the now. </p>
        <p>The workshop is open to both Persian and non-Persian speakers. No prior experience is necessary. I will guide participants step-by-step through the formation of selected Persian letters in the Nastaliq style. Our focus will be on rhythm, flow, and the meditative experience of creating with presence and intention.</p>
        <p>We will begin with a brief introduction to the history and philosophy of Persian calligraphy, setting the stage for a live demonstration of traditional tools and techniques. This includes the use of reed pens (qalam), handmade paper, natural inks, and the intricate process of shaping pen tip (tarash-e-qalam).</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the workshop becomes a shared meditation where visual art, Persian poetry, and mindful presence intertwine in silent beauty and balance inviting each participant into a deeper connection with self, words, and structures.</p>

    <p class="showTex">As a woman artist whose work centers on the theme of life, I feel a profound responsibility to honor the “Woman, Life, Freedom” movement, a powerful uprising that began in Iran and continues to echo across the world.</p>
    <p class="showTex">This work is a tribute to the women and men who stood with courage and to all who gave or risked their lives in pursuit of freedom, dignity, and justice. As an artist, I believe those of us who carry a sense of social responsibility must preserve the echoes of those voices; voices that may have been silenced, yet continue to resonate through the timeless, universal language of visual expression.</p>
    <p class="showTex">Driven to leave my homeland, I have lived in Italy since 2008. Over time, I've come to understand that “Women, life, freedom” is not a regional slogan, it is a universal, human demand. It speaks not only to women’s rights, but to the dignity and humanity of all people. When women are free and at peace, the entire society is given the chance to heal, grow, and flourish.</p>
    <p class="showTex">In a society where women are respected, children grow under the guidance of conscious, calm, and educated mothers, learning from their presence the true essence of love, dignity, strength, and wisdom. Such a society builds a world that is kinder, more beautiful, and truly worthy of life.</p>
    <p class="showTex">In this piece, the words are intricately woven together, yet at the heart lies a single, quiet point; subtle, still, and essential. Positioned at the center of the composition, it acts as a quiet anchor, a unifying force. From this stillness, everything unfolds and ultimately returns, just as harmony arises from complexity, and unity is born from multiplicity.</p>
    <p class="showTex">This structure honors both individual significance and collective harmony.The point serves as a symbol of unity and simultaneously, a metaphor for the self: the origin, the carrier of meaning, the source of energy. Yet it is only through its relationship with other elements that the point gives rise to order and wholeness. From point to letter, letter to phrase, phrase to message, it is a journey from one to many, and from the many a return to unity.</p>
    <p class="showTex">This composition becomes a dialogue between self and society, a space where individuality and connection flow together in harmonious exchange.  </p>
    <p class="showTex">The scorched edges of the paper speak of time’s passage, quiet resistance, and the wounds history refuses to heal, marks that endure, unerasable. Here, art is not only representation, but remembrance, a conscious act of remembering, a refusal to let the past be erased.</p>
    <p class="showTex">The illumination and layout of this piece was composed by Narvan, featuring the classical Persian manuscript-style framing along the borders. The central paper is handmade Indian cotton, delicately mounted onto the passe-partout using the traditional starch-pressing technique for lasting quality and authenticity.</p>

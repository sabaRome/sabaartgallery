    <p class="showTex">Life is like a flower; delicate, radiant, and fleeting yet filled with meaning and emotion. A flower symbolizes tenderness, diversity, and the quiet beauty hidden within life’s briefest moments. Just as a flower blooms only under the right conditions, so does the human soul flourish, not only through external care, but through deep nourishment of the mind, the heart, and the inner emotional world.</p>
    
    <p class="showTex">This is a nourishment not drawn from the outside world, but one that rises from within, from the thoughts we cultivate, the emotions we nurture, and the invisible threads that connect us to ourselves and the world around us. A calm mind and a nourished soul are like fertile soil where life can flourish, meaning can take root, and beauty can be embraced with greater depth.</p>
    
    <p class="showTex">In this artwork, the word “گل “ meaning “flower” in English lies at the heart of the composition, symbolizing life itself, a luminous center within the infinite. Its graceful extension toward the edges evokes a sense of vastness, openness, and the unbounded nature of our human experience. </p>
    
    <p class="showTex">Here beauty is not confined to appearance; it rises from within, unfolding endlessly, just as the words and emotions in this piece reach beyond the borders of the page, refusing to be confined.</p>
    
    <p class="showTex">
        Through the harmony of form, material, and meaning, the poetic phrase “life is flower to the power of infinity” becomes more than language, it transforms into a visual experience that speaks to the soul.
        It reminds us that every life with all its fragility, emotions, and fleeting nature is like a flower: when nurtured with awareness and care, it holds the power to bloom endlessly in beauty and meaning.
        The illumination and layout of this piece were composed by Narvan featuring the traditional “Hal-Kari” technique in the background and classical manuscript-style framing along the borders. The central paper is handmade Indian cotton, carefully mounted onto the passe-partout using the traditional starch-pressing method for lasting quality and authenticity.

    <p class="showTex">Inspired by Sohrab Sepehri’s verse, ‘Life is a flower to the power of infinity,’ this calligraphic piece transforms poetry into visual art, a gentle reminder to notice the beauty in life and let flowers guide our sense of wonder.</p>

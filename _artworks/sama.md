    <p class="showTex">In Persian culture, Samā‘ is the sacred, whirling dance of the Dervishes, a circular movement not meant to entertain, but to transcend. It is a mystical practice aimed at uniting the inner self with the greater truth of existence.</p>
    <p class="showTex">It is the body’s language for conversing with meaning, a silent dance that begins within, moves toward the center of being, and radiates outward in profound connection with all creation.</p>
    <p class="showTex">
        In this artwork, the words are not just meant to be read, they are meant to be felt, lived, and experienced.
        Samā‘ embodies a living dance, an awakened presence that is fully connected, deeply aware, and alive in each passing moment.
    </p>
    <p class="showTex">
        The piece revolves around a verse by Sohrab Sepehri, the poet of stillness and being:<br>
        “Let us open the door to humanity, to light, to the plant, and to the insect.”
    </p>
    <p class="showTex">The repetition of “و” the Farsi equivalent of “and” in this verse and throughout the calligraphy transcends its role as a simple conjunction. It becomes rhythm, movement, a spiritual pulse that breathes life into the text. </p>
    <p class="showTex">And humanity... and light... and plants... and insects... and... and... and...</p>
    <p class="showTex">The letter (و) "vā" with its graceful, spiraling curve, dances like a whirling Dervish, ever turning, ever uniting. It is more than a letter; it is a sacred gesture of meaning: a bridge between word and image, sound and silence, the part and the whole.</p>
    <p class="showTex">Each “و” in this piece is a doorway, an invitation to acceptance, to embracing difference, to the beauty of coexistence.</p>
    <p class="showTex">This composition invites the viewers to embrace all beings, to honor the sacred presence in every form of life, and to live with an open heart and a mind ready to receive. </p>
    <p class="showTex">By placing ‘humanity’ alongside ‘light,’ ‘plant,’ and ‘insect,’ we are gently reminded that we are only a part of this living world, not its center, but one presence among many, equal in existence, and bound by the shared responsibility to care for it.  </p>
    <p class="showTex">The rhythm of the pen, the repetition of forms, and the texture of the script all move in quiet harmony, like a Samā‘ in ink and soul, turning silently toward the divine.</p>
    <p class="showTex">
        Samā‘ is more than calligraphy.<br>
        It is a sacred dance on the paper,<br>
        an invitation to enter the moment,<br>
        to awaken presence,<br>
        to live with awareness,<br>
        to feel the invisible thread that binds all things,<br>
        and to celebrate the oneness that unites us all.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="showTex">The illumination and layout of this piece was composed by Narvan, featuring the classical Persian manuscript-style framing along the borders. The central paper is handmade Indian cotton, delicately mounted onto the passe-partout using the traditional starch-pressing technique for lasting quality and authenticity.</p>

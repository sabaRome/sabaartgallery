<h3>A Life in Lines and Layers</h3>

<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; padding-top: 3rem;">
SaBa is an architect and visual artist whose work explores the fluid dialogue between history, design, and cultural identity. Her passion for preservation goes beyond architecture, it embraces the timeless beauty and wisdom woven into Persian calligraphy and poetry. Through a contemporary artistic lens, she breathes new life into ancient traditions, honoring the past while reimagining it for the present.

She earned her Master’s degree in architecture from Roma Tre University in Italy in 2017, where she cultivated a deep appreciation for historical preservation, the art of honoring ancient structures while thoughtfully integrating contemporary design. This philosophy now flows into her visual art, where she merges the graceful fluidity of Nastaliq Persian calligraphy with the expressive abstraction of Siyah Mashq. The result is a dynamic interplay of structure and spontaneity, tradition and innovation.

SaBa’s work is a visual dialogue between past and present, tradition and modernity. Through the deconstructing and reimagining of Persian script, she breathes life into language, transforming it into a rhythmic, living form. Her art invites the viewer to experience meaning not just as text, but as motion and emotion. Each piece becomes a bridge through time, preserving cultural heritage while reinterpreting it for the contemporary world.

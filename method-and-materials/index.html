<h2>Crafting the Unrepeatable</h2>

<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; padding-top: 3.5rem;">
In my artwork, letters and words come alive in a single uninterrupted motion, with no possibility of erasing or rewriting,  like a musical note played once, never to be repeated. Unlike most forms of painting, where layers can be added and corrections made, Persian calligraphy allows no second chances. It demands mastery in the moment, where the final composition is born in one continuous breath. Each stroke’s thickness and delicacy are shaped by the width and angle of the reed pen’s tip and the precise direction of its movement across the paper. Every gesture requires absolute control to preserve proportion, rhythm, and harmony. Yet, within this discipline lies a powerful spontaneity: each letter created in real time, guided not by repetition, but by instinct, presence, and flow. Unlike pre-drawn letters, filled in with ink later, Persian calligraphy is a living, breathing act of creation, where shape and movement emerge organically guided by both technical precision and artistic intuition.

In Persian calligraphy, the formation of each letter and word, beyond composition, follows timeless principles refined over centuries. Mastery of these principles is not merely a skill but a lifelong discipline, demanding years of devoted practice. Through this dedication, the artist internalizes balance, rhythm, and proportion until the pen moves not from habit, but from presence. Each stroke flows seamlessly from mind to hand, as if the ink itself were guided by spirit.

Traditionally, calligraphic artworks are adorned with Tazhib (illumination), a refined decorative art painted with gouache and brought to life through the hands of skilled artisans. In my own practice, I occasionally collaborate with Tazhib artists, though my abstract calligraphy is designed to stand alone, complete, expressive, and whole even without illumination. Tazhib, while historically paired with calligraphy, is an independent art form in its own right. All illumination in these pieces was created by Narvan (Nesa Bakhshi), a talented artist devoted to the traditional elegance of Persian Tazhib.

The primary tools and materials for creating calligraphic artwork are:
</p>
<ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; padding-top: 0.5rem;">
  <li>
    <span class="font-bold">Reed pen</span>
    <span>(Latin: calamus,  Ancient Greek: κάλαμοι kalamoi; singular κάλαμος kalamos, Qalam Ney in Persian)</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="font-bold">Ink</span>
    <span>(Traditional handmade Persian ink or commercially available industrial ink)</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="font-bold">Handmade paper</span>
    <span>(Iranian, Turkish, or Indian, typically made from 100% natural fibers and cotton)</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="font-bold">Passe-partouts</span>
    <span>(handcrafted with starch-based technique) </span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; padding-top: 0.5rem;">
Each tool in the calligrapher’s hand undergoes a meticulous and time-intensive process of crafting and preparation. Among them, the reed pen (Qalam Ney) plays a crucial role, as its angle and tip thickness directly influence the clarity, elegance, and precision of each stroke. Cutting the reed at the perfect angle is more than a technical task, it is an art in itself, honed over years of practice to ensure every letter flows with balance, rhythm, and beauty.

A deep understanding of the reed pen’s characteristics is essential to achieving excellence in traditional calligraphy. Among the most esteemed are Dezfouli reed pens, known for their durability and fine craftsmanship making them ideal for small-scale writing. The city of Dezful in southern Iran is renowned for its climate for cultivating premium-quality reeds, making it a trusted source for master calligraphers. For medium-sized compositions, northern Iranian reeds are used for their balance and structure. For larger scripts, artisans turn to specially carved wooden pens with a paddle-like tip, designed for broad, expressive strokes. While metal and polymer pens are available, they lack the subtle flexibility and sensitivity needed to capture the fluid beauty of classical Persian calligraphy.

The earthy tones and handmade paper whisper of old stories, rituals, something meant to last. Burnt edges touched by fire evoke the feeling of fragility and strength, the idea that this paper survived something and therefore holds meaning. The paper doesn’t just support a message, it is the message. It says: “What’s written or painted here matters. It came through fire, earth, and hand. It remembers you.”
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; padding-top: 0.5rem;">
Beyond the tools of creation, the presentation of the artwork is equally significant. The passe-partouts, decorative borders that frame the work, are handcrafted through a meticulous, multi-layered process. Each is composed of two layers of acid-free Fabriano cardboard topped with a thin delicate layer of patterned natural paper. Assembled using a traditional starch-based technique, the entire process takes one to two weeks, ensuring that every frame is crafted with the same care, intention, and artistry as the piece it surrounds.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 32px; padding-top: 0.5rem;">
Every element, from the cut of the reed pen to the final presentation, is infused with intention, tradition, and precision, elevating Persian calligraphy into both an art form and a meditative experience.
